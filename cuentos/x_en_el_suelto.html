                    As it is well known that the 'wise men' came 'from the East,' and asMr. 
                    Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows that Mr.Bullet-head 
                    was a wise man; and if collateral proof of the matter beneeded, here we have 
                    it- Mr. B. was an editor. Irascibility was hissole foible, for in fact the 
                    obstinacy of which men accused him wasanything but his foible, since he justly 
                    considered it his forte. Itwas his strong point- his virtue; and it would have 
                    required all thelogic of a Brownson to convince him that it was 'anything else.' 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and theonly occasion 
                    on which he did not prove infallible, was when,abandoning that legitimate home
                    for all wise men, the East, hemigrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-
                    nopolis, or some placeof a similar title, out West. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I must do him the justice to say, however, that when he made uphis mind finally 
                    to settle in that town, it was under the impressionthat no newspaper, and 
                    consequently no editor, existed in thatparticular section of the country. In 
                    establishing 'The Tea-Pot' heexpected to have the field all to himself. I feel 
                    confident he neverwould have dreamed of taking up his residence inAlexander-
                    the-Great-o-nopolis had he been aware that, inAlexander-the-Great-o-nopolis, 
                    there lived a gentleman named JohnSmith (if I rightly remember), who for many 
                    years had there quietlygrown fat in editing and publishing the 'Alexander-the-
                    Great-o-nopolisGazette.' It was solely, therefore, on account of having 
                    beenmisinformed, that Mr. Bullet-head found himself in Alex-suppose wecall it 
                    Nopolis, 'for short'- but, as he did find himself there, hedetermined to keep up his 
                    character for obst- for firmness, andremain. So remain he did; and he did more; he 
                    unpacked his press,type, etc., etc., rented an office exactly opposite to that of 
                    the'Gazette,' and, on the third morning after his arrival, issued thefirst number of 
                    'The Alexan'- that is to say, of 'The NopolisTea-Pot'- as nearly as I can 
                    recollect, this was the name of the newpaper.

                The leading article, I must admit, was brilliant- not to say severe.It was especially 
                bitter about things in general- and as for theeditor of 'The Gazette,' he was 
                torn all to pieces in particular. Someof Bullethead's remarks were really so 
                fiery that I have always, sincethat time, been forced to look upon John Smith, 
                who is still alive, inthe light of a salamander. I cannot pretend to give all 
                the'Tea-Pot's' paragraphs verbatim, but one of them runs thus: 
            </p>
            <p> <em>
                'Oh, yes!- Oh, we perceive! Oh, no doubt! The editor over the way is a genius- O, 
                my! Oh, goodness, gracious!- what is this world coming to? Oh, tempora! Oh, 
                Moses!' </em> 
            </p>
            <p> 
                A philippic at once so caustic and so classical, alighted like abombshell among the 
                hitherto peaceful citizens of Nopolis. Groups of excited individuals gathered at the 
                corners of the streets. Everyone awaited, with heartfelt anxiety, the reply of the 
                dignified Smith.Next morning it appeared as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>'We quote from "The Tea-Pot" of yesterday the subjoined paragraph:"Oh, yes! Oh, 
                we perceive! Oh, no doubt! Oh, my! Oh, goodness! Oh,tempora! Oh, Moses!"</em> Why, the 
                fellow is all O! That accounts for hisreasoning in a circle, and explains why there 
                is neither beginning norend to him, nor to anything he says. We really do not believe 
                thevagabond can write a word that hasn't an O in it. Wonder if this O-ingis a habit of his? 
                By-the-by, he came away from Down-East in a greathurry. Wonder if he O's as much there as 
                he does here? <em> "O! it ispitiful."' </em>

                The indignation of Mr. Bullet-head at these scandalous insinuations,I shall not 
                attempt to describe. On the eel-skinning principle,however, he did not seem to be 
                so much incensed at the attack upon hisintegrity as one might have imagined. It was 
                the sneer at his stylethat drove him to desperation. What!- he Touch-and-go Bullet-head!-
                not able to write a word without an O in it! He would soon let thejackanapes see that he 
                was mistaken. Yes! he would let him see howmuch he was mistaken, the puppy! He, Touch-and-go 
                Bullet-head, of Frogpondium, would let Mr. John Smith perceive that he, Bullet-head, could 
                indite, if it so pleased him, a whole paragraph- aye! a wholearticle- in which that 
                contemptible vowel should not once- not evenonce- make its appearance. But no;- that 
                would be yielding a pointto the said John Smith. He, Bullet-head, would make no alteration 
                inhis style, to suit the caprices of any Mr. Smith in Christendom.Perish so vile a thought! 
                The O forever; He would persist in the O. Hewould be as O-wy as O-wy could be.

                Exhausted, very naturally, by so stupendous an effort, the greatTouch-and-go could attend 
                to nothing farther that night. Firmly,composedly, yet with an air of conscious power, 
                he handed his MS. tothe devil in waiting, and then, walking leisurely home, retired,with 
                ineffable dignity to bed.

                Meantime the devil, to whom the copy was entrusted, ran up stairs tohis 'case,' 
                in an unutterable hurry, and forthwith made a commencementat 'setting' the MS. 'up.'

                Burning with the chivalry of this determination, the greatTouch-and-go, in the next 
                'Tea-Pot,' came out merely with thissimple but resolute paragraph, in reference to this 
                unhappy affair:

            <p>
                In the first place, of course,- as the opening word was 'So,'- he made a 
                plunge into the capital S hole and came out in triumph with acapital S. 
                Elated by this success, he immediately threw himself uponthe little-o 
                box with a blindfold impetuosity- but who shalldescribe his horror when 
                his fingers came up without the anticipatedletter in their clutch? who 
                shall paint his astonishment and rage atperceiving, as he rubbed his 
                knuckles, that he had been onlythumping them to no purpose, against 
                the bottom of an empty box. Not asingle little-o was in the little-o 
                hole; and, glancing fearfully atthe capital-O partition, he found that 
                to his extreme terror, in aprecisely similar predicament. Awe- stricken, 
                his first impulse was torush to the foreman.

                <em>'What do you mean by that?' </em> growled the foreman, who was in a 
                veryill humor at being kept so late.

                'Ah, well, then! do the best you can with it! We must get to press' </em>,said

                The exigency here described is by no means of rare occurrence inprinting-offices; 
                and I cannot tell how to account for it, but thefact is indisputable, that when 
                the exigency does occur, it almostalways happens that x is adopted as a substitute 
                for the letterdeficient. The true reason, perhaps, is that x is rather the 
                mostsuperabundant letter in the cases, or at least was so in the oldtimes- 
                long enough to render the substitution in question anhabitual thing with printers. 
                As for Bob, he would have consideredit heretical to employ any other character,

                The uproar occasioned by this mystical and cabalistical article, is 
                not to be conceived. The first definite idea entertained by thepopulace 
                was, that some diabolical treason lay concealed in thehieroglyphics; 
                and there was a general rush to Bullet-head'sresidence, for the purpose 
                of riding him on a rail; but that gentlemanwas nowhere to be found. 
                He had vanished, no one could tell how; andnot even the ghost of him 
                has ever been seen since.

                Unable to discover its legitimate object, the popular fury 
                at lengthsubsided; leaving behind it, by way of sediment, 
                quite a medley ofopinion about this unhappy affair.
            </p>
            <p>  
                One gentleman thought the whole an X-ellent joke. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another said that, indeed, Bullet-head had shown much X-uberanceof fancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                A third admitted him X-entric, but no more.
            </p>
            <p> 
                A fourth could only suppose it the Yankee's design to X-press, 
                ina general way, his X-asperation.
            </p>
            <p> <em>
                'Say, rather, to set an X-ample to posterity,' </em> suggested a fifth. 
                That Bullet-head had been driven to an extremity, was clear toall; 
                and in fact, since that editor could not be found, there was sometalk 
                about lynching the other one.

                The more common conclusion, however, was that the affair was,simply, 
                X-traordinary and in-X-plicable. Even the town mathematicianconfessed 
                that he could make nothing of so dark a problem. X, every.body knew, 
                was an unknown quantity; but in this case (as he properlyobserved), 
                there was an unknown quantity of X.

                The opinion of Bob, the devil (who kept dark about his having 'X-edthe 
                paragrab'), did not meet with so much attention as I think itdeserved, 
                although it was very openly and very fearlessly expressed. He said that, 
                for his part, he had no doubt about the matter at all,that it was a clear 
                case, that Mr. Bullet-head 'never could bepersuaded fur to drink like other 
                folks, but vas continuallya-svigging o' that ere blessed XXX ale, and as a 
                naiteral consekvence,it just puffed him up savage, and made him X (cross) 
                in the X-treme.'

        <h2>Opinión Personal</h2>
        <p>
            Este cuento nos narra la historia de un editor de periódico al cual se le acusa de abusar 
            del uso de la letra "O" en un artículo por lo que se le reta a escribir un suelto 
            sin utilizar dicha letra. Centrado en el orgullo, el editor decide, entonces, redactar
            el suelto con la mayor cantidad de "Oes".
            El cuento habla de una forma chusca sobre la firmeza, obstinación y orgullo del hombre 
            y la rivalidad común en el trabajo. Considero que al no saber manejar correctamente
            estas emociones y no conseguir expresarnos de una forma precisa podemos quedar 
            avergonzados ante todos, justo como el personaje de este cuento.
