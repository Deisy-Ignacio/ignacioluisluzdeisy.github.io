                As it is well known that the 'wise men' came 'from the East,' and asMr. 
                Touch-and-go Bullet-head came from the East, it follows that Mr.Bullet-head 
                was a wise man; and if collateral proof of the matter beneeded, here we have 
                it- Mr. B. was an editor. Irascibility was hissole foible, for in fact the 
                obstinacy of which men accused him wasanything but his foible, since he justly 
                considered it his forte. Itwas his strong point- his virtue; and it would have 
                required all thelogic of a Brownson to convince him that it was 'anything else.'

            <p>
                I have shown that Touch-and-go Bullet-head was a wise man; and theonly occasion 
                on which he did not prove infallible, was when,abandoning that legitimate home
                for all wise men, the East, hemigrated to the city of Alexander-the-Great-o-
                nopolis, or some placeof a similar title, out West.
